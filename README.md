# About
This mod aims to improve the NPC's reactions to the player, so they seem less deaf and/or blind. It is fully customizable via Native Settings Mod Menu.

The AI system of Cyberpunk 2077 is actually quite brillant. However, some values supposed to trigger that system are set so cautiously (if at all), it is not being activated sometimes. This mod tries to address the issue, hopefully giving players an even more immersive experience with Cyberpunk.

## Current features:
- Adds and/or fixes AI stimuli broadcasts for doors, body disposals & radios, including proper differentiation between interaction types and their corresponding stimuli 
(e.g. in vanilla, quickhacking a door to open it emits the same sound for NPCs as "unlocking" it via brute force, while reactions to normal door interactions are inconsistent at best)
- Increases various stimuli ranges, categorized by loudness (customizable)
- Fixes some odd NPC behaviour in Public Zones
- 100% customizable via Native Settings Mod Menu

I've kept this mod as non-invasive as possible, using minimal scripting and only hooking functions I really needed to. It doesn't touch the actual AI code at all, but only the functions supposed to activate it.
As such, it should be compatible with pretty much anything
